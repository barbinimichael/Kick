# Kick FrontEnd

A single-page web application for user's to access the Kick Service.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed at https://kick-share.com using FireBase.

## Technologies

The Kick Frontend user interface is developed using the React library. The frontend takes advantage of React being component-based to build reusabled, ensapulated code.  
In addition, the Bootstrap framework was used to make the application responsive and work well within mobile applications.  
The Redux library was used to maintain global states necessary in the application. In order to avoid complex and messy call backs for states that would need to persist throughout the frontend (such as whether the user is signed-in), Redux's store functionality was used.
